# LangGraph Projects

Welcome to the LangGraph tutorial! This guide will walk you through the fundamental concepts of LangGraph, focusing on **nodes** and **edges**, and show you how to build and visualize computational graphs for language tasks.

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a framework for building structured, graph-based workflows for language models and AI agents. It allows you to define computation and control flow using **nodes** and **edges**, making complex applications easier to design, debug, and extend.

## Core Concepts

### Nodes

A **node** represents a distinct unit of computation or a step in your workflow. In LangGraph, nodes can be:

- **Function nodes**: Execute a function or a model call.
- **Input nodes**: Provide initial data or parameters.
- **Output nodes**: Aggregate or format final results.

Each node has a unique identifier and can have input and output ports for data exchange.

#### Example:  

```python
graph.add_node("summarize", summarize_function)
```
This creates a node named `"summarize"` that uses your custom `summarize_function`.

### Edges

An **edge** connects two nodes, representing the flow of data or control between them. Edges define the sequence and dependencies in your graph.

- **Directed edges**: Data flows from source node to target node.
- **Conditional edges**: Flow depends on conditions or outputs.

#### Example:  
```python
graph.add_edge("input", "summarize")
graph.add_edge("summarize", "output")
```
Here, data flows from the `"input"` node to `"summarize"`, and then to `"output"`.

## Example Workflow

```python
import langgraph

graph = langgraph.Graph()
graph.add_node("input", input_function)
graph.add_node("summarize", summarize_function)
graph.add_node("output", output_function)

graph.add_edge("input", "summarize")
graph.add_edge("summarize", "output")

result = graph.run(initial_data)
```
